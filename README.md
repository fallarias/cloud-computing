## Software Description
The Isabela State University Staff Attendance System is a web-based platform designed to streamline and 
manage the attendance records of teaching personnel within the university. Developed using web technologies, this system provides functionalities for staff registration, logging of time-in and time-out, and generating attendance overviews. The system aims to replace traditional methods of attendance tracking with a more efficient and digital approach.

## Key Features of the System Include:

<b>Staff Registration:</b> A module for administrators to add new staff members to the system, capturing essential details such as ID number, name, and department.
<b>Time Logging:</b> A user-friendly interface for staff members to record their time of arrival (Time-In) and departure (Time-Out).
<b>Attendance Logs:</b> A comprehensive record of staff attendance, displaying individual time-in and time-out entries along with the corresponding dates.
<b>Staff List Management:</b> A module to view and manage the registered staff members, allowing for editing and deletion of records.
<b>Attendance Overview:</b> A visual representation of attendance data through bar charts, providing insights into staff presence over specific periods.
<b>Secure Login:</b> A login portal for authorized users (likely administrators and potentially staff) to access the system's functionalities.

<b>Problems of the Existing System:</b>
Based on the observation of the current process of using the potential problems with the existing attendance tracking methods at Isabela State University might include:
<b>Potential for Manipulation:</b> Manual records might be susceptible to tampering or inaccuracies.
<b>Familiarity for Some Users:</b> Staff who have been using manual systems for a while might be familiar with the underlying principles of attendance logging, potentially easing the transition to a digital system. 
<b>Direct Physical Evidence (Potentially):</b> Manual logs, when properly maintained, can offer direct physical 
evidence of attendance, which might have been perceived as a reliable method in the past.

## Scope of the Proposed System 

The proposed Isabela State University Staff Attendance System aims to address the limitations of manual 
attendance tracking by providing a digital and centralized platform. The system is designed to improve 
efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of attendance management for teaching personnel.

<b>The Key Features and Functionalities of the Proposed System Include:</b>

<b>User Management:</b>
 Staff registration with fields for ID Number, First Name, Last Name, Middle Initial, and Department.
 Functionalities for administrators to add, view, edit, and delete staff records.
 Secure login for system access.

<b>Attendance Tracking:</b>
- A dedicated interface for staff to log their Time In and Time Out.
- Automatic recording of timestamps for entry and exit.
- A comprehensive log displaying the date, Time In, and Time Out for each staff member.

<b>Attendance Reporting:</b>
- Generation of visual reports, such as bar charts, to summarize attendance data over specified periods.

<b>User Interface:</b>
- A web-based interface accessible through standard web browsers.
- A navigation menu for easy access to different modules (Home, Staff List, Logs, Add New Staff, Log
Out).
- User-friendly forms for data input and display.
- The system utilizes a client-server architecture, where users interact with the web interface (client) to access and manage attendance data stored on a server.

## Key Interfaces of the Staff Attendance System:

<b>Login Page:</b> Features fields for Email and Password, along with a "Login" button and a separate "Staff Attendance" button (potentially for a simplified time-in/out interface).
